# Ascender-GGJ-2014
A platformer made by a small team of students from the University of Bedfordshire as part of Global Game Jam 2014. The game was made in 48 hours under the theme 'We don't see things as they are, we see them as we are' and the modifiers we used were 'You Only Live Thrice' (Only 3 lives) and 'I Am Who I Want To Be' (Non-gender specific characters).
